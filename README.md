# minmodpy
This is for those who cant install mods for minecraft
Just drop a .jar file and it will be copied to the mods folder of minecraft
You can also install forge ore fabric/api
And DONT! drag Files from the Desktop. I dont know why but that doesnt work
If someone knows why it doesnt work please contact me
